# path_planning_algorithms

### 
Implemented different path planning algorithms on a map image using OpenCV.
The map image was treated as an occupancy grid with pixels as its nodes. The initial and final goal position pixels were provided and the optimal path was computed using different path planning algorithms.



### Results
- #### A* Algorithm
Implemented on a simple map in openCV
